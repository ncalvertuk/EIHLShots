# EIHLShots
Python scripts to analyse EIHL shot data from the 2019-20 season. Data analysis is performed on the shot data to look at the trends in shooting distance, angle, situation, etc. I built a shot quality model, prediciting the probability that a shot results in a goal or not using a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest.
